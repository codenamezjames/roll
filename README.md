# roll 
A command line dice roller

You can do everything by moving the script to your ```/usr/local/bin``` or ```/usr/bin directory```, and typing ```roll``` into the command line. This is done with ```sudo mv roll.py /usr/local/bin/roll``` or ```sudo mv roll.py /usr/bin/roll```.

## Requirements
Python

### Arguments
The script takes arguments in DnD dice form. This means if you wanted to roll one 20-sided die, you would type ```1d20```. It accepts any form of die. 

### Example Arguments
```roll 1d20```

```roll 2d6```

```roll 1d20 2d6 1d10 2d8``` and so on and so on.

### This is useless. You suck.

No, I'm gonna use it for DnD. No one asked you.
